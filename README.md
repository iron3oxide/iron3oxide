### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jason
#### I am a python developer
My main weakness as a developer is what I call the shiny-new-toy-fallacy: If I discover a promising new piece of technology, I will be very tempted to drop my old toys to play with the new one, even though I know way less about it.

On the plus side, that means I tend to know cutting edge libraries, services and maybe even programming languages. On the not-so-plus side, I sometimes drop "proven" tech a bit too early and have to admit to myself and others later on that the new stuff isn't there yet.
